CSC625 Final Project: Workout Tracking Database (with Front End UI Code)

As people strive to become the healthiest and most fit version of themselves, the personal training industry has begun to thrive. For clients and trainers involved in a personal training program, there are many different attributes that need to be kept track of, such as, trainers, clients, payments, workouts, and nutritional plans. In attempt to make the training and health journey of all easier and more accessible, the goal is to create and effective and efficient database for a personal training company to organize and access all data. 

The database will implement tables, stored procedures, triggers, and user roles to organize and access various data in a simple, effective, and secure format. There will be two main roles, clients and trainer. Clients will be able to track workouts, set fitness and nutrition goals, view progress, and see payment schedule. The trainer role will have the ability to manage clients, create workout and nutrition plans, and monitor clientâ€™s progress. 

The project will effectively manipulate data through tasks such as adding and retrieving clients, assigning and collecting workouts, creating, assigning and viewing workout plans, and adding and viewing payment details. The project will keep data safe with restraints such as preventing client deletion. Additionally, the project efficiently manipulates data with automatic updates of calorie totals, payments due totals, and setting payment due dates. 

The workout tracking dashboard data will be organized, saved, and manipulated using Microsoft Sequel Server and Sequel Server Management Studio. Further, the front end will be structured and displayed using HTML, PHP and CSS. Connectivity will be established through SQL Server and Windows Authentication mode, connecting to public server hosting IP.
